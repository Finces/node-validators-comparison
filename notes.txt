SUBJECTIVE GRADES
------------------

    validatorjs:
        documentation -> clear, descriptive, with examples
        difficulty -> intuitive, rather easy
        community -> ok, there are solutions for problems
        custom rules -> easy to implement, there are examples
        comfort of use -> nice syntax, but missing common validation rules (email, phone, uuid, ...)

    class-validator:
        documentation -> tons of examples, perfect documentation
        difficulty -> very intuitive, easy, however requires some work with class-transformer
        community -> help is easy to find
        custom rules -> easy to implement, explained with examples
        comfort of use -> the best

    joi:
        documentation -> clear, descriptive, with examples
        difficulty -> rather easy
        community -> a lot of problem solutions
        custom rules -> didn't have to implement, but it seems relatively easy
        comfort of use -> very comfortable

    valivar:
        documentation -> it's ok
        difficulty -> rather easy
        community -> practically non existing
        custom rules -> very easy to implement
        comfort of use -> not bad

    jsonschema:
        documentation -> there is some, but could be much better
        difficulty -> caused the most problems
        community -> there is more than one jsonschema validator, so they kind of overlap
        custom rules -> complicated, I failed to achieve what I wanted (repeated_password to password comparison)
        comfort of use -> I didn't like it, would not use this

    ajv:
        documentation -> it's ok
        difficulty -> rather easy, once gotten used to
        community -> didn't have much problems, but solutions are rather easy to find
        custom rules -> didn't have to use it, but it seems rather easy
        comfort of use -> it's ok, with added formats there is a lot of predefined validation rules/formats
